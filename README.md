# Smart-Diaper
An ESP32-C3-based IoT system to monitor diaper wetness, temperature, and gas emissions using capacitive moisture sensors and the DS18B20 sensor.The system integrates with Firebase Realtime Database for remote data access, tracks wetness frequency over 24 hours to detect possible dehydration, and resets counters daily. I ensure robust Wi-Fi connectivity with auto-reconnect and optimize sensor readouts for reliable, low-cost health monitoring, particularly for infant and elderly care.
